alerta-ng Release 9.1
=====================

> **This is alerta-ng, a community-maintained fork of [Alerta](https://github.com/alerta/alerta).**
>
> The upstream project is no longer actively maintained — issues and pull requests are not
> being reviewed or released. alerta-ng exists to keep the project moving: merging fixes that
> are already sitting unmerged upstream, keeping dependencies and supported Python versions
> current, and continuing to develop the application for production use.
>
> alerta-ng is a drop-in replacement: the importable package is still `alerta`, and the
> `alerta.plugins` and `alerta.webhooks` entry points are unchanged, so existing plugins and
> deployments keep working.
>
> alerta-ng is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by the upstream maintainers.
> Please report issues here, not on the upstream tracker.

The Alerta monitoring tool was developed with the following aims in mind:

*   distributed and de-coupled so that it is **SCALABLE**
*   minimal **CONFIGURATION** that easily accepts alerts from any source
*   quick at-a-glance **VISUALISATION** with drill-down to detail

Requirements
------------

Release 9 only supports Python 3.9 or higher.

The only mandatory dependency is MongoDB or PostgreSQL. Everything else is optional.

- Postgres version 13 or better
- MongoDB version 6.0 or better

Installation
------------

To install MongoDB on Debian/Ubuntu run:

    $ sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
    $ mongod

To install MongoDB on CentOS/RHEL run:

    $ sudo yum install -y mongodb
    $ mongod

To install the alerta-ng server and the Alerta client run:

    $ pip install alerta-ng-server alerta
    $ alertad run

Note that `alerta-ng-server` replaces the upstream `alerta-server` distribution: both
install the same `alerta` package, so they cannot be installed side by side. Uninstall
`alerta-server` first when migrating an existing environment. The `alerta` client above
is the unmodified upstream CLI and is unaffected.

To install the web console run:

    $ wget https://github.com/alerta/alerta-webui/releases/latest/download/alerta-webui.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf alerta-webui.tar.gz
    $ cd dist
    $ python3 -m http.server 8000

    >> browse to http://localhost:8000

### Docker
Alerta and MongoDB can also run using Docker containers, see [alerta/docker-alerta](https://github.com/alerta/docker-alerta).

Configuration
-------------

To configure the ``alertad`` server override the default settings in ``/etc/alertad.conf``
or using ``ALERTA_SVR_CONF_FILE`` environment variable::

    $ ALERTA_SVR_CONF_FILE=~/.alertad.conf
    $ echo "DEBUG=True" > $ALERTA_SVR_CONF_FILE

Documentation
-------------

More information on configuration and other aspects of alerta can be found
at <https://docs.alerta.io>. Those are the upstream project's docs; they
describe the codebase alerta-ng is forked from and remain accurate for
anything alerta-ng has not changed. Differences introduced by this fork are
documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Development
-----------

To run in development mode, listening on port 5000:

    $ export FLASK_APP=alerta FLASK_DEBUG=1
    $ pip install -e .
    $ flask run

To run in development mode, listening on port 8080, using Postgres and
optionally reporting errors to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) (set `SENTRY_DSN`
to your own project's DSN; error reporting is disabled when it is unset):

    $ export FLASK_APP=alerta FLASK_DEBUG=1
    $ export DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/alerta5
    $ export SENTRY_DSN=https://<key>@<organisation>.ingest.sentry.io/<project>
    $ pip install -e .[postgres]
    $ flask run --debugger --port 8080 --with-threads --reload

Troubleshooting
---------------

Enable debug log output by setting `DEBUG=True` in the API server
configuration:

```
DEBUG=True

LOG_HANDLERS = ['console','file']
LOG_FORMAT = 'verbose'
LOG_FILE = '$HOME/alertad.log'
```

It can also be helpful to check the web browser developer console for
JavaScript logging, network problems and API error responses.

Tests
-----

To run the *all* the tests there must be a local Postgres
and MongoDB database running. Then run:

    $ TOXENV=ALL make test

To just run the Postgres or MongoDB tests run:

    $ TOXENV=postgres make test
    $ TOXENV=mongodb make test

To run a single test run something like:

    $ TOXENV="mongodb -- tests/test_search.py::QueryParserTestCase::test_boolean_operators" make test
    $ TOXENV="postgres -- tests/test_queryparser.py::PostgresQueryTestCase::test_boolean_operators" make test

Cloud Deployment
----------------

Alerta can be deployed to the cloud easily using Heroku <https://github.com/alerta/heroku-api-alerta>,
AWS EC2 <https://github.com/alerta/alerta-cloudformation>, or Google Cloud Platform
<https://github.com/alerta/gcloud-api-alerta>
